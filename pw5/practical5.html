      <h2 id="a"><em>What is a box model in CSS. Give box-sizing property definition</em></h2>

      <p>The box model in CSS is a concept that defines the rectangular box that surrounds every element. It consists of the content, padding, border, and margin of the element.
         The `box-sizing` property allows you to control how the width and height of an element is calculated, either including or excluding the padding and border.</p>

      <h2 id="b"><em>What is a “clearfix hack” and when does it need to be applied</em></h2>

      <p>The "clearfix hack" is a CSS technique that prevents an element from collapsing when its child elements are floated. 
        It is needed when you want to create a layout where a parent element contains child elements that are floated side-by-side.</p>

      <h2 id="c"><em>What is a “margin collapse” and what are the use cases for margin: auto and negative margin values</em></h2>

      <p>Margin collapse is a CSS phenomenon that occurs when the margins of two or more adjacent elements collapse into a single margin. 
        This can happen when the elements are siblings or when they are nested inside each other.</p>

        <img src="mc2.png" alt="margin_collapse2">

      <p>Margin collapse can be used to create certain layout effects, such as centering an element within its parent element. 
        The `margin: auto` property can be used to center an element horizontally, and negative margin values can be used to create overlapping elements.</p>

      <h2 id="d"><em>What was the problem with achieving Holy Grail layout</em></h2>

      <p>The problem with achieving Holy Grail layout was that it was difficult to create a layout that was both flexible and cross-browser compatible. 
        The Holy Grail layout is a three-column layout with a fixed-width header and footer, and a fluid-width content area. In the early days of CSS, it was difficult to create this layout using only CSS, as the `float` property did not behave consistently across browsers.</p>

      <h2 id="e"><em>What are the modern ways to achieve Holy Grail layout</em></h2>

      <p>There are several modern ways to achieve Holy Grail layout, including using flexbox, CSS grid, or a CSS framework such as Bootstrap. These techniques provide more flexibility and cross-browser compatibility than the traditional methods.</p>
